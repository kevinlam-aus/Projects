Additional Business Rules
    1.	There are two classifications of users: customers and administrators (admins).
    Users can register themselves as customers, but admins cannot register themselves as admins.  
    An existing admin can add a customer to the admin role using the RoleAdmin pages.

    2.	Only admins can see the page to change the role of a customer (RoleAdmin).  
    Anonymous users and registered customers should not see the link to Manage Users.  
    If non-admins attempt to visit the page by typing in the URL, they should see either a request to log in or an error page.
