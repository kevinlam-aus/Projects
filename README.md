# College Projects
A quick glimpse into my coding experience both personal and professional.

There are two main folders in this repository, both folders highlight my accomplishments in learning a language.

Projects in the 'professional' folder are projects I have taken on in academic or professional settings but changed in respect to the professors and previous employers.

Projects in the 'personal' folders are projects I have taken up on my own time. Their functions may not neccessessarily have any professional utility but still demonstrate my abilities.
